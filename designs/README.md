## Guidelines for Design Management

Welcome to the Designs Repository for our university project! Below are some casual guidelines to help us keep things running smoothly:

### Rules

- **Exporting Design Updates**: Whenever we make design changes, export all affected pages and drop them here.

### Procedure

1. **Exporting Design Changes**:
   - After updating designs, export the pages and drop them into the repository.

2. **Keeping Track**:
   - Write descriptive commit messages to track changes.

3. **Team Collaboration**:
   - Stay in touch with the team to align on design goals.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Conduct regular design reviews and incorporate feedback.

5. **Ease of Access**:
   - Keep things organized so everyone can find what they need.
