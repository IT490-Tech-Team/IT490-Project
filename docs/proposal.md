# BookQuest

An online bookshelf management tool that allows users to easily find and save books tailored to their interests. After making an account, users can read reviews and leave their own in-depth reviews and ratings on books. Registered users can also access their own personal bookshelf, where they can save books and sort them as they please. Based on reviews and reading history, the website will also recommend books to the user.

## Features

- **Search function**: Users can search for books based on various fields and filter out undesirable books (including genre, author, year published, ratings, language, etc).
- **Book information**: Users can read relevant information about the books they select.
- **Review and rating system**: Users can leave reviews on books and rate them on a scale of 1 to 10, or read other users’ reviews.
- **Personal bookshelf**: Users can add books found on the website to their account’s personal bookshelf and sort them as desired (read, plan to read, do not read, etc). Users can make their bookshelves publicly available on the website for other users to view, or keep them private.
